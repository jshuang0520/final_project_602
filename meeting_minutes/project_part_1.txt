dataset you plan on using: 
BATTERY AND HEATING DATA IN REAL DRIVING CYCLES
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/atechnohazard/battery-and-heating-data-in-real-driving-cycles/data


outline any cleaning or other preprocessing steps you plan to use:
1. check if it is a imbalanced data, and deal with it using different strategies
  - oversampling
  - undersampling
  - generate synthetic data (e.g. SMOTE, ADASYNC)

2. check if there are missing values

3. check the data types for each columns, to see if the defaul ones are set reasonablly

4. examine outliers for each feature

5. specify distributions between each csv dataset (because according to its description, there are summer and winter data)


our goal:
use linear regression model to predict the working temperature / use multiple models to make  prediction, and compare the effectiveness of these models
